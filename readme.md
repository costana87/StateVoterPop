The purpose of this map is to highlight the number of registered voters in each state as of 2024 for this upcoming election period. For the map elements, the base map is centered over the United States becuase this is where the data is all located. The colors on the map show the number of registered voters in each state. The darker the shade of green the more registered voters there are as shown in the legend. I chose these colors because I thought they looked good and allowed the different states to stand out better. You are also able to hover over each state and the number of registered voters will appear in the top right.
